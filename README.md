# Nano-Banana-Shorts-Editor
This repository serves as a test integrating the new Gemini model, Gemini capturing frame rates, and editing short clips for marketing materials.

We have a few models or a few different repositories to integrate in this one being overall inference to generate these images The other one being a repository handling frame rates. So basically what we'll do is we'll have upload a video This will be the overall workflow upload a video Gemini will process the video decide these vector points out the video either objects that you know They're need effects added to it or text that should be added to it in certain terms of frames, right? So, and we'll probably want to have some type of persistence throughout frames, but perhaps not essential necessary immediately.

### This is going to be the process.
1. Upload of video.
2. Video Processed by AI model Gemini - Gemini process determining certain vector points, either objects of significance that can be enhanced or effected in some capacity, or times or moments of high value of text additions to frames.
   
   2.1 - This will use two repositories, internal, one of which being the AI proxy core for abstraction into just using these AI providers, and then the other one being a media processor, being able to extract frames from videos.

   2.2 - The Model would be given functions to read and write to videos, these would include a research/inference phrase, an editing phase,and review phase.

3. Use Cases:

   3.1. overlay commentor content

   3.2. translations

   3.3. general editor functionality

   3.4. AR/MR Functionality   
   
4. Output Updated video
